Face tracking and categorization based on MDP, scikit-learn, and cv2.  Currently implements age, gender, smile, and glasses.

I currently own all copyright to this code - I haven't chosen what license to use.  If you want to use it for whatever, just let me know and we can work something out.

To run: unrar the big model in models, then call python camera_feed.py from the src folder.

To build models: edit main for workflow.py to your desire.
